App Description - The app creates a server that lets users choose either 1 or more out of the 4 beatles. Once they choose their 
artists, the app adds their selection to a mongodb database. The user can then see additional information regarding their chosen
beatles in an information page. The console also shows the number of instagram posts the selected beatles have using an API.
